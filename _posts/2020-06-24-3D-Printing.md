Polylactic acid AKA, PLA, is by far the most popular 3D printing material available, and for good reason. 
It’s one of the most inexpensive, a breeze to print with, and comes in hundreds of different colors and blends. 

PLA is one of the easiest materials to print, unconcerned about having exact print settings. 
Temperatures are flexible, warping is minimal, and there are no strong print odors. 
For this exact reason, many people have only ever printed PLA. If you’re just getting into 3D printing, it’s a great place to start.

PLA is also known for its print quality. It has the best detail reproduction of the common 3D printing filaments, 
making it ideal for models where aesthetics are important. Easily taking pigments, 
PLA is also available in all sorts of vibrant colors and blends, as seen above.
