As already mentioned, PLA is extremely flexible when it comes to print settings. 
As long as your bed is level, your printer is in good working order, and your settings are in the right ballpark, 
prints should (generally) succeed. We go into the ins and outs of nailing PLA print settings in a separate guide,
but for a quick reference, the following is what your settings should look like. 
(Note: If your printer comes with PLA print profiles, these should already be well-tuned.)

-Nozzle Temperature: 190–220 °C

-Bed Temperature: 0 °C (with blue painter’s tape) or 50–70 °C

-Print Speed: 10–100 mm/s (depending heavily on the printer’s capabilities)

As with other materials, make sure that your bed is level and clean before starting a print. If your prints aren’t sticking well to the print surface, you may need to dial in more specific first layer settings.
